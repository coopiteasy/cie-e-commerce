With this module installed, the "Add to cart" popup is always shown when
clicking on add to cart button. Even if the product has no optional
product.

By default in Odoo, this popup is only shown when the product has
optional product configured correctly. Here the goal is to always show
this popup to let user pursue shopping after adding an item to cart.
