This module adds the ability to define different Customer
Type and assign it to partner.

A Customer Type brings functionality to :

- Restrict products that a customer can view on the e-commerce to a list
  of allowed products.
- Force the customer to login before accessing to the e-commerce.
- Redirect the customer to a specific location after the selection of
  its type (see Customer Type Selector Popover).

All of these features can be activated or not.

It also implement a Customer Type Selector that popups on the e-commerce
page at the first visit of a new customer (if configured).

Configuration
=============

Product Restriction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To restrict products that a user can see on the e-commerce an Customer
Type should be assigned to the partner associated with the User used by
the customer. If this partner is a contact of a company, the Customer
Type should be assigned to the company.

Then on the Customer Type, the `website_restrict_product` field should
be set to `True` **and** the field `website_product_ids` should be
filled with some products. When the `website_restrict_product` is set,
the only product that this user will see will be the one in the
`website_product_ids` list. If this list is empty, the user will see no
product on the e-commerce.

To assign product to a Customer Type, it can also be done by adding the
Customer Type directly on the Product form under the *Website
Restriction* topic.

!Waring! The product are filtered on the e-commerce **only** if the
customer is logged in !


Customer Type Selector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, this module don't show a Customer Selector on the
e-commerce. The goal of the Customer Selector is to let the user choose
his type of customer a be guided to the right procedure to connect.

Customer Type can be configured under *Contacts > Configuration >
Customer Type*.

To enable the Customer Selector on the e-commerce, it must exists at
least one Customer Type with the *Show On Website* property set to True.

Usage
=====

Type to your partners.
