This module adds the ability to define several Customer
Type and assign it to partner.

A Customer Type brings functionality to :

- Restrict products that a customer can view on the e-commerce to a list
  of allowed products.
- Restrict acquirers that a customer can use on the e-commerce to a list
  of allowed acquirers.

You can chose to filter only products, only acquirers or both for each
Customer Type.

Configuration
=============

Customer Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Customer Type can be configured under *Contacts > Configuration >
Customer Type*.


Product Restriction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To restrict products that a user can see on the e-commerce an Customer
Type should be assigned to the partner associated with the User used by
the customer. If this partner is a contact of a company, the Customer
Type should be assigned to the company.

Then on the Customer Type, the `website_restrict_product` field should
be set to `True` **and** the field `website_product_ids` should be
filled with some products. When the `website_restrict_product` is set,
the only product that this user will see will be the one in the
`website_product_ids` list. If this list is empty, the user will see no
product on the e-commerce.

To assign product to a Customer Type, it can also be done by adding the
Customer Type directly on the Product form under the *Website
Restriction* topic.


Acquirer Restriction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the Customer Type, the `website_restrict_acquirer` field should
be set to `True` **and** the field `website_acquirer_ids` should be
filled with some acquirers. When the `website_restrict_acquirer` is set,
the only acquirer that this user will see will be the one in the
`website_acquirer_ids` list. If this list is empty, the user will see all
activated/published acquirers.

To assign acquirer to a Customer Type, it can also be done by adding the
Customer Type directly on the Payment Acquirer form under the *Configuration* tab.


Customer Type for non-connected user
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, user that are not logged in on the e-commerce will have no
Customer Type. So no restriction will be applied.

To set a default Customer Type that applies on user that are not
connected on the e-commerce, do the following:

- Go to Configuration > Users
- Remove de default filter and select the filter "Inactive Users".
- Search for "Public" and select the "Public User".
- Click on the partner linked to this user.
- On the partner form set a Customer Type and save.

The Customer Type set on the "Public User" will be used for users that
are not connected to the e-commerce.

Usage
=====

Configure Customer Type as shown in the Configure section. Then assign
Customer Type to your partners.

If you have configured products on the customer type, you will see only
these when logged in with a proper account. Idem for payment acquirer.
